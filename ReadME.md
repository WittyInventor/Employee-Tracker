  ## Description:  
  I made this project in order to learn mysql and node in javascript and to generate a professional
  employee tracker that helps a business owner view organize and plan their business through
  the ability to view and manage departments, roles and employees.

  
  ## Installation: 
  Inquirer, MySQL2 package, and console.table package needs to be installed. 
  
  ## Usage: 
  After installations, the user sees a list of options to select and selects their answers which displays: what would you like to do which prompts the following steps of adding a role, adding an employee, adding a department, updating an employee role, viewing all departments, viewing all roles, and viewing all employees. After completion of those selection, the next series of selected answers displays a table of what user chose.
